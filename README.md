Arma Animation: Open Source Animation mod for Arma 3
=====


Arma Animation is an open source animation project for Arma 3. 
Thanks to Bohemia, we are now free to animate weapons as we please.
I am not a master animator, however I believe that the animations provided here
are a good start to creating an animation pack that will better suit modded content.

This is not to be confused with HLC as that is an animation pack made by Toadie2K (check it out, seriously good stuff)

You are free to download, distribute, fork, commit, whatever. As long as it move the project forward!
